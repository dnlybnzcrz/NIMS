Synchronization Plan for MobileApp/src/screens/News.js and Website/src/components/News.js

1. Pagination:
   - Use server-side pagination for both Mobile and Website for consistency and performance.
   - Mobile already uses server-side pagination with page and limit.
   - Website currently fetches all news and paginates client-side.
   - Modify Website to fetch news with page and limit query params like Mobile.
   - Replace react-paginate with server-side pagination controls or infinite scroll.

2. Search/Filter:
   - Both implement similar search/filter logic.
   - Ensure search queries are applied on the client side after fetching paginated data.
   - Keep search input and filtering consistent in both.

3. Add Report Modal:
   - Both have add report modal.
   - Ensure modal open/close and adding new report updates news list similarly.

4. Edit Story Modal:
   - Both have edit story modal.
   - Ensure modal open/close and updating news list is consistent.

5. Media Modal:
   - Both have media modal.
   - Ensure media files display similarly.
   - Use platform-appropriate modal components.

6. Delete Confirmation:
   - Mobile uses Alert; Website uses window.confirm.
   - Keep platform-appropriate confirmation dialogs.

7. News Item Display:
   - Display author name, station, lead, tags, date/time, media button, remarks, and actions.
   - Ensure consistent formatting and data presence checks.

8. Actions:
   - Edit and Delete actions present in both.
   - Use platform-appropriate UI elements (buttons, dropdowns).

9. Loading and Refresh:
   - Mobile uses ActivityIndicator and pull-to-refresh.
   - Website should have loading indicator and refresh button or auto refresh.

10. Misc:
    - Ensure consistent error handling and user feedback.
    - Ensure consistent styling and UX patterns per platform.

Next Steps:
- Implement server-side pagination in Website/src/components/News.js.
- Adjust search/filter logic if needed.
- Verify and align add report, edit story, media modal, delete confirmation, and news item display in both files.
- Test both implementations for feature parity.

This plan will guide the synchronization of features between the two News.js files.
